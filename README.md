# Forever Project

A space used for prototyping and learning about whatever types of software.

## Description

This isn't a project that will contain a specific piece of software. It is intended to be a kind of playground, a "sandbox" to try out and learn about a bunch of software-related things, ranging from algorithms to design patterns, or from tools over games and simulation models to (why not) the internals of an operating system.

All code in this space is about learning and growing, not about delivering a working piece of software.

## Folders / subprojects

Following folders with subprojects are present in the tree:

- data-types: contains specific value object and value type implementations.
    - MandatoryString: a string type can is guaranteed to always contain a non-null, non-empty, non-whitespace string value.
- func-prog: projects that implement extensions to assist a style of functional programming in C#.
    - Disposable: a project containing extensions to convert the use of disposable objects in a functional style.
