# Value type - MandatoryString

This project implements a string type that cannot be either null, empty or completely whitespace.

## Value type or value object?

Usually, you'll find people only taking about value objects and sometimes value types. It looks like
they are used interchangeably. The only difference I make, is that value objects are reference types
(aka 'class') while a value type will be put on the stack (aka 'struct').
